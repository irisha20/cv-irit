    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p class="intro">I'm looking for a Web Development position. After 15 years in the high-tech industry in mostly Marketing roles such as SEO/ASO Expert, Project Manager, Webmaster & Online Operations Manager  I decided to finally follow my heart and move to
      development and coding which was something I always loved. During my marketing career, I always sought for technical challenges such as working with Wordpress, Drupal, Tridion CMS (from a developer side), implementing all the technical aspects with analytical tools like Mixpanel, Google Analytics and more.
